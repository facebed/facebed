# For developers and maintainers

## Deployment

1. Install `python>=3.12` with `pip` and `virtualenv`
2. Clone this repository
3. Copy `start.example.py` to `start.py` and edit the `PYTHON` variable to point to your venv or 
system installation (not recommended)
4. Copy `user_config.example.py` to `user_config.py` and edit the self-explanatory options
5. Start the `start.py` script

## Remote updating
This feature allows remote update triggers (git pull-ing and running a restart command)
for instance maintainers. The `/update` endpoint is protected with HTTP username and password,
which are set in the file `user_config.py`.

## Cookies (DO NOT USE)
Use the cookies exported using the extension Cookie Editor with the json format. Will warn 
maintainers if any cookies expired.
**DO NOT USE RIGHT NOW, WILL CAUSE A CHECKPOINT ON YOUR ACCOUNT**

## Start command and virtual environment
I recommend running `facebed` in a virtual environment if you don't want to pollute your
system-wide python installation.

Copy `start.example.py` to `start.py` and edit the `PYTHON` variable to the full path of
your python interpreter. Two examples are provided for running `facebed` in a `venv` virtual environment on
Windows and Linux. After that, you can start `facebed` by running `python start.py` using your 
system's python since that script doesn't have any external dependencies.
